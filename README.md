#WhenIm50

At the current moment, our project simply takes in the name and age of the user and prints out their name and how many years until they turn 50. The project is quite simple but is definitely useful if you want to know how close you are to the big 5 0. 

For people looking to help add the project, we are looking to expand the ages you can check and other things you can do with what the program asks. Users can access WhenIm50.ipynb to see the code and look at what changes they would like to make. 

However with any changes please follow our code of conduct or you can no longer contribute to the project.
