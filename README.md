# hello-world
I opened this on Saturday and just saw the group requirement today. I have been sick all week and tested positive for COVID-19 on Wednesday, so I was not able to attend classes this week. If you would like me to find a group, I can email someone from a smaller group. Either way, this project will be submitted with the other requirements that you asked for.


The code will take in your name and age subtract your age from 50, and print out how many years you will be 50.

Ryan Farrar- I am one of the people He emailed and will work on the license and code of conduct. I chose the code of conduct that I did because it covered all of the main issues I would want to be covered. (Harassment, basic standards) I chose the license because I want the code to be able to be used by anyone with very few limitations.
