I openned this on Saturday and just saw the group requirement today. I have been sick all week and tested positive for Covid on Wednesday, so I was not able to attend classes this week. If you would like me to find a group, I can email someone from a smaller group. Either way, this project will be submitted with the other requirements that you asked for.


The code will take in your name and age and subtract your age from 50, and print out in how many years you will be 50.
